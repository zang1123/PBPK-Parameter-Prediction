Molecular fingerprints are employed as predictor variables with the presence of a fingerprint bits as 1 and the absence as 0. Procedure for generation of fingerprint bits for model building:

[1] Convert chemical names to CASRN (Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number):

http://cts.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/conversion/batch

[2] Convert CASRN to SMILES strings (Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System) using ChemCell program:

[3] Convert SMILES strings to Fingerprints using PaDEL program:

[4] 8097 fingerprint bits are generated from PaDEL program. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select optimal subsets of fingerprint bits.
